# SyncList
SyncList is a task management app developed by SwiftSync. Users can dynamically add and remove tasks with dates, useful for keeping track of anything they need.
# Features
- Custom task adding/removing
- 3 separate categories to sort tasks into
- Multi-user same device support via login screen and user credentials
- Notifications
# Usage
Source code is provided via both the releases tab and the repo itself. The source code can then be loaded into Android Studio for testing. Additionally, a compiled APK file is provided via the actions tab for use on a physical device. Internet access should not be required. If you wish to use notifications, ensure that you grant the appropriate permissions in the settings page.
